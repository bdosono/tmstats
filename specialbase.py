# In case WHQ messes up the base membership for clubs, we can override it here.  
# Programs which use the base membership must import specials from this routine.
# specials is a directory of clubname/base pairs, like so:
specials = {1:14, 2:10}
# normally, though, there aren't any overrides, so it's empty:
specials = {}
