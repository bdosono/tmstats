# Things to do for District 101's TMSTATS

Establish Github workflow with pull requests:
    - Trivial test case (this one)

Convert all code to Python 3:
    - Install Python 3.7 on DreamHost
    - Find all the Unicode hacks and get rid of them

Clean up the shell scripts:
    - In particular, refactor so that each major step is in its own script
    - Refactor environment setup for consistency 

Make program and script names consistent:
    - Right now, there's a mix of 'build', 'do', 'make' as the first part of the name, and it's hard to figure out what's what.

Make the process of loading club info consistent:
    - Right now, handling the spreadsheets which contain overriding information is done by several separate calls; instead, have getClubsOn take parameters to control the overriding.  
    - Even better, create a Clubs class which, when instantiated, gets all of the club info and returns it as an array of Club instances.

Use Requests throughout:
    - Get rid of the old calls to urllib2 and urllib3

Make intentional decisions on the use of Google spreadsheets vs. Excel:
    - When using a Google spreadsheet, use the API so that changes are immediately reflected.

Clean up the realignment process:
    - Distinguish between 'pre-DEC', 'post-DEC', and 'post-Business Meeting' phases
    - Create output files suitable for the DEC (with colors, awards, likely-to-close) and the world (without those) every time

Add all officers to the 'officers' file and encapsulate it:
    - This would allow, for example, sendawardmail.py to always have the current PQD's name.

Clean up getperformancefiles.py:
    - Go forward from last available data, not backwards
    - When we have data for a date, don't look for it in a previous month

Merge the performance tables:
    - They are three different files at Toastmasters, but they are logically one table.
    - This will require quite a bit of work on the SQL statements embedded in the code.

Use GetTMYearFromDB consistently:
    - This is based on a todo from 10 Mar 2016 in commit d9952f5e831a658a8d3e3444c0e4ac71a54b8a9d

Use distance_on_unit_sphere consistently:
    - This is based on a todo from 12 Apr 2016 in commit 7848212425ec58c9903cc90f336eb8729d3dff3e

Merge the map-making routine with buildclubsbycity and buildareapage:
    - Should all be done together
    - The output from buildclubsbycity should be sortable and filterable using [jQuery datatables](https://datatables.net)
    - the findclubsbycity page should have the proper decorations for the site instead of being a naked page.
    - It would be nice to make the map page look like the rest of the site, too.
    - Also, generate two maps:  the existing map with area and division markers and a new map with standard Google markers, possibly color-coded to distinguish open and closed clubs (this latter map would be used on the find-a-club page).
    - The output from buildareapage should include club meeting time and place.
